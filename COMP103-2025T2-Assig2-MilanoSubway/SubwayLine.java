/**
 * SubwayLine
 * Information about a Subway Line.
 * Note, we treat the two directions on a physical line as two separate lines.
 * There is therefore an M5-north line that goes from San-Siro-Stadio to Bignami,
 *    and an M5-south line that goes in the reverse direction from Bignami to San-Siro-Stadio. 
 * Although they have the same stations, the stations will be in opposite orders.
 *
 * A SubwayLine contains 
 * - the name of the SubwayLine (M1, M2, etc followed by its direction north, south, west or east)
 * - The list of stations on the line
 * - a list of LineServices running on the line (eg the 10:00 am service from Bignami to San-Siro-Stadio)
 *   (in order of time - services earlier in the list are always earlier times (at any station) than later services)
